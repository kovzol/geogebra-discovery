The binary file qepcad.exe has been compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, by using
a fork of QEPCAD at https://github.com/PetterS/qepcad.
Instead of compiling a Debug build (which is provided in the package),
a Release build was used. (A Debug build has issues on stopping
when L is undefined.) Here the architecture was also changed to x86
to ensure better compatibility.

The binary file ggbgiac.wasm has been compiled by using the repository
https://github.com/kovzol/giac.
